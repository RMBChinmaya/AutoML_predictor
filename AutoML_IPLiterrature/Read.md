The motivation of this project was to develop an offline GUI to run autoML models.
The base AutoML model used in this case is AWS AutoGluon.
Currently there are 2 interfaces to run AutoML: a) TKinter b) Streamlit
To run either of ther interfaces run their respective python files.
The code has been tested for following use cases:
    1.  IP literature prediction
    2.  Regression analysis
    3.  Stock/ETF trend analysis

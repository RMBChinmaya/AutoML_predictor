# About this Repo

The motivation of this project was to develop an offline GUI to run AutoML models.
The base AutoML model used in this case is **AWS AutoGluon**.

## Interfaces

Currently, there are two interfaces to run AutoML:

1. **TKinter** 
2. **Streamlit**

To run either of these interfaces, execute their respective Python files.

## Use Cases

The code has been tested for the following use cases:

1. **IP Literature Prediction**
2. **Regression Analysis**
3. **Stock/ETF Trend Analysis**
